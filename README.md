# The-Windows-Tweaker-Project
A group of programs, written in Windows Batch, capable of increasing your PC's performance. 

**This is a non-profit project. I firmly believe that anyone who owns a computer, deserves their computer to be performing as fast as possible.**

There are a bunch of other toolboxes, applications, programs and whatnot, for the same purpose served by this project, but what makes THIS project different, is the fact that by running just 1 single program (!START!.bat), all optimizations will begin, one by one. You don't need to go through a large list of options, perform a number of google searches, select the optimizations you want to take place on your PC and then click OK or Apply and then restart your PC. This project basically saves you a lot of time; time which you can utilize to use your computer more for the purpose you bought it and less for searching for ways to resolve performance related issues.

You also have the option to undo any changes you made, either via the system restore point and registry backups this project automatically creates(if you are not satisfied with any of the optimizations), or manually by running some programs.

Here's a simple description of all optimizations, to improve your performance, present here:

**Disables Animations**

**Disables Transparency Effects**

**Disables the functions required for virtual machines(if you don't use them)**

**Disables some non-critical windows services and sets some to open manually**

**Changes DNS to cloudflare 1.1.1.1, to improve network speed**

**Disables power throttling and enables the ultimate performance power plan (Desktops and always plugged in laptops only)**

**Disables the windows telemetry service and similar services, to prevent microsoft from collecting data.**

**Allows you to check what apps are installed(including bloatware) and remove the unecessary ones.**

*Protip: If you want to apply all optimizations individually, go to the folder named 'Individual Tweaks'. You'll find what you're looking for there.*


Thank you for reading this. Have a wonderful day!
