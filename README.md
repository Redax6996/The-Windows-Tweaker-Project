# The-Windows-Tweaker-Project
A group of programs, written in Windows Batch, capable of increasing your PC's performance. Also includes bonus tips and tricks.  

**This is a non-profit project. I firmly believe that anyone who owns a computer, deserves their computer to be performing as fast as possible.**

There are a bunch of other toolboxes, applications, programs and whatnot, for the same purpose served by this project, but what makes THIS project different, is the fact that by running just 1 single program (!START!.bat), all optimizations will begin, one by one. You don't need to go through a large list of options, perform a number of google searches, select the optimizations you want to take place on your PC and then click OK or Apply and then restart your PC. This project basically saves you a lot of time; time which you can utilize to use your computer more for the purpose you bought it and less for searching for ways to resolve performance related issues.

You also have the option to undo any changes you made, either via the system restore point and registry backups this project automatically creates(if you are not satisfied with any of the optimizations), or manually by running some programs.

Descriptions of every single program are provided in .txt files, in appropriate locations throughout. The main programs of this project are available in the _main_ branch.

Thank you for reading this. Have a wonderful day!
